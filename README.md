<h2>Overveiw</h2>
<p>This project is a remote controlled car that featurs a stabalized platform on it. The car is controlled with your phone over wifi and uses 2 wheels to push the car around in diffrent directions. The stabalized platfor uses motors to keep the platform steady.</p>

<h2>System Details</h2>
<p> The design of the Satabalized Car is very complicated due to many features it provides. The movment of the wheels is caused by simple 5v DC motors that are controlled by a l298n motor controler. The motor controler is hooked up to a Node MCU 1.0 witch is a wifi capable development board. The power is delivered by a 7.2v Lithium polemer battery. The stabalization is created with 3 servo motors in a gimbal mount orintation. The servos are controlled by an Arduino Nano and the Nano receives positional and rotational inputs bassed off a small MPU gyroscope. The phone controlability is due to the Node MCU unit witch is connected through a softwere called Blynk witch lets you control devices through their servers.</p>
